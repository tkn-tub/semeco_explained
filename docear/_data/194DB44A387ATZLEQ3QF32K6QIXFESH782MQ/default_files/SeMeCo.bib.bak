  abstract = {Metabolites can inhibit the enzymes that generate them. To explore
	the general nature of metabolic self-inhibition, we surveyed enzymological
	data accrued from a century of experimentation and generated a genome-scale
	enzyme-inhibition network. Enzyme inhibition is often driven by essential
	metabolites, affects the majority of biochemical processes, and is
	executed by a structured network whose topological organization is
	reflecting chemical similarities that exist between metabolites.
	Most inhibitory interactions are competitive, emerge in the close
	neighbourhood of the inhibited enzymes, and result from structural
	similarities between substrate and inhibitors. Structural constraints
	also explain one-third of allosteric inhibitors, a finding rationalized
	by crystallographic analysis of allosterically inhibited L-lactate
	dehydrogenase. Our findings suggest that the primary cause of metabolic
	enzyme inhibition is not the evolution of regulatory metabolite-enzyme
	interactions, but a finite structural diversity prevalent within
	the metabolome. In eukaryotes, compartmentalization minimizes inevitable
	enzyme inhibition and alleviates constraints that self-inhibition
	places on metabolism. © The Author(s) 2017.},

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments show that social interactions between bacterial
	cells can drive evolutionary change at the population level, but
	significant challenges limit attempts to assess the relevance of
	these findings to natural populations, where selection pressures
	are unknown. We have increasingly sophisticated methods for monitoring
	phenotypic and genotypic dynamics in bacteria causing infectious
	disease, but in contrast, we lack evidence-based adaptive explanations
	for those changes. Evolutionary change during infection is often
	interpreted as host adaptation, but this assumption neglects to consider
	social dynamics shown to drive evolutionary change in vitro. We provide
	evidence to show that long-term behavioral dynamics observed in a
	pathogen are driven by selection to outcompete neighboring conspecific
	cells through social interactions. We find that Pseudomonas aeruginosa
	bacteria, causing lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis,
	lose cooperative iron acquisition by siderophore production during
	infection. This loss could be caused by changes in iron availability
	in the lung, but surprisingly, we find that cells retain the ability
	to take up siderophores produced by conspecifics, even after they
	have lost the ability to synthesize siderophores. Only when cooperative
	producers are lost from the population is the receptor for uptake
	lost. This finding highlights the potential pitfalls of interpreting
	loss of function in pathogenic bacterial populations as evidence
	for trait redundancy in the host environment. More generally, we
	provide an example of how sequence analysis can be used to generate
	testable hypotheses about selection driving long-term phenotypic
	changes of pathogenic bacteria in situ.},

	In the current fourth phase, there is a critical mass of studies

	successes in this field of research include deriving underlying principles

  abstract = {Metabolism is built on a foundation of organic chemistry, and employs
	structures and interactions at many scales. Despite these sources
	of complexity, metabolism also displays striking and robust regularities
	in the forms of modularity and hierarchy, which may be described
	compactly in terms of relatively few principles of composition. These
	regularities render metabolic architecture comprehensible as a system,
	and also suggests the order in which layers of that system came into
	existence. In addition metabolism also serves as a foundational layer
	in other hierarchies, up to at least the levels of cellular integration
	including bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology.
	The recapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these
	higher levels, motivates us to interpret metabolism as a source of
	causation or constraint on many forms of organization in the biosphere.
	Many of the forms of modularity and hierarchy exhibited by metabolism
	are readily interpreted as stages in the emergence of catalytic control
	by living systems over organic chemistry, sometimes recapitulating
	or incorporating geochemical mechanisms. We identify as modules,
	either subsets of chemicals and reactions, or subsets of functions,
	that are re-used in many contexts with a conserved internal structure.
	At the small molecule substrate level, module boundaries are often
	associated with the most complex reaction mechanisms, catalyzed by
	highly conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a biosynthetically and functionally
	distinctive control layer over the small-molecule substrate. The
	most complex members among the cofactors are often associated with
	the reactions at module boundaries in the substrate networks, while
	simpler cofactors participate in widely generalized reactions. The
	highly tuned chemical structures of cofactors (sometimes exploiting
	distinctive properties of the elements of the periodic table) thereby
	act as ‘keys’ that incorporate classes of organic reactions within
	biochemistry. Module boundaries provide the interfaces where change
	is concentrated, when we catalogue extant diversity of metabolic
	phenotypes. The same modules that organize the compositional diversity
	of metabolism are argued, with many explicit examples, to have governed
	long-term evolution. Early evolution of core metabolism, and especially
	of carbon-fixation, appears to have required very few innovations,
	and to have used few rules of composition of conserved modules, to
	produce adaptations to simple chemical or energetic differences of
	environment without diverse solutions and without historical contingency.
	We demonstrate these features of metabolism at each of several levels
	of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule metabolic substrate
	and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved
	reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse
	physical and biochemical processes in cells.},

	biomolecular networks took the form that we observe today. Cellular
	metabolism is probably one of the most ancient biological networks
	and constitutes a good model system for the study of network evolution.
	While many evolutionary models have been proposed, a substantial
	body of work suggests metabolic pathways evolve fundamentally by
	recruitment, in which enzymes are drawn from close or distant regions
	of the network to perform novel chemistries or use different substrates.
	Here we review how structural and functional genomics has impacted
	our knowledge of evolution of modern metabolism and describe some
	approaches that merge evolutionary and structural genomics with advances
	in bioinformatics. These include mining the data on structure and
	function of enzymes for salient patterns of enzyme recruitment. Initial
	studies suggest modern metabolism originated in enzymes of nucleotide
	metabolism harboring the P-loop hydrolase fold, probably in pathways
	linked to the purine metabolic subnetwork. This gateway of recruitment
	gave rise to pathways related to the synthesis of nucleotides and
	cofactors for an ancient RNA world. Once the TIM β/α-barrel fold
	architecture was discovered, it appears metabolic activities were
	recruited explosively giving rise to subnetworks related to carbohydrate
	and then amino acid metabolism. Remarkably, recruitment occurred
	in a layered system reminiscent of Morowitz's prebiotic shells, supporting
	the notion that modern metabolism represents a palimpsest of ancient
	metabolic chemistries.},

  abstract = {All microorganisms release many metabolites, collectively known as
	the exometabolome. The resultant multi-way cross-feeding of metabolites
	among microorganisms distributes resources, thereby increasing total
	biomass of the microbial community, and promotes the recruitment
	and persistence of phylogenetically and functionally diverse taxa
	in microbial communities. Metabolite transfer can also select for
	evolutionary diversification, yielding multiple closely related but
	functionally distinct strains. Depending on starting conditions,
	the evolved strains may be auxotrophs requiring metabolic outputs
	from producer cells or, alternatively, display loss of complementary
	reactions in metabolic pathways, with increased metabolic efficiency.
	Metabolite cross-feeding is widespread in many microbial communities
	associated with animals and plants, including the animal gut microbiome,
	and these metabolic interactions can yield products valuable to the
	host. However, metabolite exchange between pairs of intracellular
	microbial taxa that share the same host cell or organ can be very
	limited compared to pairs of free-living microorganisms, perhaps
	as a consequence of host controls over the metabolic function of
	intracellular microorganisms. Priorities for future research include

  abstract = {Micro-organisms play a central role in every ecosystem and in the
	global biomass cycle. They are strongly involved in many fields of
	human interest, from medicine to the food industry and waste control.
	Nevertheless, most micro-organisms remain almost unknown, and nearly
	99\% of them have not yet been successfully cultured in vitro. Therefore,
	new approaches and new tools must be developed in order to understand
	the collective behaviour of microbial communities in any natural
	or artificial setting. In particular, theoretical and practical methodologies
	to deal with such systems at a mesoscopic level of description (covering
	the range from 100 to 108 cells) are required. Individual-based modelling
	(IBM) has become a widely used tool for describing complex systems
	made up of autonomous entities, such as ecosystems and social networks.
	Individual-based models (IBMs) provide some advantages over the traditional
	whole-population models: (a) they are bottom-up approaches, so they
	describe the behaviour of a system as a whole by establishing procedural
	rules for the individuals and for their interactions, and thus allow
	more realistic assumptions for the model of the individuals than
	population models do; (b) they permit the introduction of randomness
	and individual variability, so they can reproduce the diversity found
	in real systems; and (c) they can account for individual adaptive
	behaviour to their environmental conditions, so the evolution of
	the whole system arises from the dynamics that govern individuals
	in their pursuit of optimal fitness. However, they also present some
	drawbacks: they lack the clarity of continuous models and may easily
	become rambling, which makes them difficult to analyse and communicate.
	All in all, IBMs supply a holistic description of microbial systems

  abstract = {Ecological systems are complex assemblies of large numbers of individuals,
	interacting competitively under multifaceted environmental conditions.
	Recent studies using microbial laboratory communities have revealed
	some of the self-organization principles underneath the complexity
	of these systems. A major role of the inherent stochasticity of its
	dynamics and the spatial segregation of different interacting species
	into distinct patterns has thereby been established. It ensures the
	viability of microbial colonies by allowing for species diversity,
	cooperative behavior and other kinds of “social�? behavior. A synthesis
	of evolutionary game theory, nonlinear dynamics, and the theory of
	stochastic processes provides the mathematical tools and a conceptual
	framework for a deeper understanding of these ecological systems.
	We give an introduction into the modern formulation of these theories
	and illustrate their effectiveness focussing on selected examples
	of microbial systems. Intrinsic fluctuations, stemming from the discreteness
	of individuals, are ubiquitous, and can have an important impact
	on the stability of ecosystems. In the absence of speciation, extinction
	of species is unavoidable. It may, however, take very long times.
	We provide a general concept for defining survival and extinction
	on ecological time-scales. Spatial degrees of freedom come with a
	certain mobility of individuals. When the latter is sufficiently
	high, bacterial community structures can be understood through mapping
	individual-based models, in a continuum approach, onto stochastic
	partial differential equations. These allow progress using methods
	of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcation analysis and invariant
	manifolds. We conclude with a perspective on the current challenges
	in quantifying bacterial pattern formation, and how this might have
	an impact on fundamental research in non-equilibrium physics.},

	that an obligate and mutual exchange of metabolites, as is very common
	among bacterial cells, could stabilize different genotypes within
	microbial communities. To test this, we developed a cellular automaton
	to model interactions among six empirically characterized genotypes
	that differ in their ability and propensity to produce amino acids.
	By systematically varying intrinsic (i.e. benefit-to-cost ratio)
	and extrinsic parameters (i.e. metabolite diffusion level, environmental
	amino acid availability), we show that obligate cross-feeding of
	essential metabolites is selected for under a broad range of conditions.
	In spatially structured environments, positive assortment among cross-feeders
	resulted in the formation of cooperative clusters, which limited
	exploitation by non-producing auxotrophs, yet allowed them to persist
	at the clusters’ periphery. Strikingly, cross-feeding helped to maintain
	genotypic diversity within populations, while amino acid supplementation
	to the environment decoupled obligate interactions and favored auxotrophic
	cells that saved amino acid production costs over metabolically autonomous
	prototrophs. Together, our results suggest that spatially structured
	environments and limited nutrient availabilities should facilitate
	the evolution of metabolic interactions, which can help to maintain
	genotypic diversity within natural microbial populations.},

  note = {Publisher: Elsevier},
  abstract = {The individual-based (aka agent-based) approach is now well established
	in ecological modeling. Traditionally, most applications have been
	to organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population
	heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles
	and behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been
	recognized for some time. However, advances in molecular biology
	and biochemistry have brought about an increase in the application
	of individual-based modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature
	review summarizes 46 IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment
	plants, phytoplankton in ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms,
	bacteria in food and other environs, and “digital organisms�? and
	“domesticated computer viruses�?in silico. The use of IBM in these
	applications was motivated by population heterogeneity (45\%), emergence
	(24\%), absence of a continuum (5\%), and other unknown reasons (26\%).
	In general, the challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes
	and higher trophic levels are similar. However, there are differences
	in the microbe population dynamics and their environment that create
	somewhat different challenges, which have led to somewhat different
	modeling concepts. Several topics are discussed, including producing,
	maintaining and changing population heterogeneity (different life
	histories, internal variability, positive feedback, inter-generation
	memory), dealing with very large numbers of individuals (different
	up-scaling methods, including representative space vs. super-individual,
	number vs. biomass based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various
	agent accounting methods), handling space, simulating interactions
	with the extracellular environment (hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian approach),
	modeling agent–agent interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving)
	and passive transport (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity,
	well-mixed reactors). Overall, the literature indicates that the
	application of IBM to microbes is developing into a mature field.
	However, several challenges remain, including simulating various
	types of agent–agent interactions (formation and function of colonies
	or filaments, sexual reproduction) and even smaller individuals (viruses,
	genes). Further increases in intracellular detail and complexity
	in microbe IBMs may be considered the combination of systems biology
	and systems ecology, or the new field of systems bioecology.},

	In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the

  abstract = {Resource competition and metabolic cross-feeding are among the main
	drivers of microbial community assembly. Yet the degree to which
	these two conflicting forces are reflected in the composition of
	natural communities has not been systematically investigated. Here,
	we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to assess the potential for
	resource competition and metabolic cooperation in large co-occurring
	groups (up to 40 members) across thousands of habitats. Our analysis
	reveals two distinct community types, which are clustered at opposite
	ends of a spectrum in a trade-off between competition and cooperation.
	At one end are highly cooperative communities, characterized by smaller
	genomes and multiple auxotrophies. At the other end are highly competitive
	communities, which feature larger genomes and overlapping nutritional
	requirements, and harbour more genes related to antimicrobial activity.
	The latter are mainly present in soils, whereas the former are found
	in both free-living and host-associated habitats. Community-scale
	flux simulations show that, whereas competitive communities can better
	resist species invasion but not nutrient shift, cooperative communities
	are susceptible to species invasion but resilient to nutrient change.
	We also show, by analysing an additional data set, that colonization
	by probiotic species is positively associated with the presence of
	cooperative species in the recipient microbiome. Together, our results
	highlight the bifurcation between competitive and cooperative metabolism
	in the assembly of natural communities and its implications for community
	modulation.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now
	been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A
	key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence
	of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective
	(e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions.
	Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions
	may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently
	practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An
	efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of
	flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal
	as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided
	for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate
	as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux
	variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and
	network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate
	optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using
	QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based
	methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux
	variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological
	significance and general source of such flux variability is further
	investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network
	(equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively,
	these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux
	distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity
	for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide
	an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions
	that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.},

  abstract = {Metabolic exchange between microbes is a crucial process driving the
	development of microbial ecosystems. The exchange of essential amino
	acids presents an opportunity to investigate the guiding principles
	underlying microbial trade in nature. In this study, we devised synthetic
	communities of Escherichia coli bacteria of increasing complexity
	to measure general properties enabling metabolic exchange of amino
	acids. We identified numerous syntrophic interactions that enable
	cooperative growth, which exhibited both positive and negative epistasis
	with increasing community complexity. Our results suggest that amino
	acid auxotrophy may be an evolutionarily optimizing strategy to reduce
	biosynthetic burden while promoting cooperative interactions between
	different bacteria in the microbiome. Metabolic crossfeeding is an
	important process that can broadly shape microbial communities. However,
	little is known about specific crossfeeding principles that drive
	the formation and maintenance of individuals within a mixed population.
	Here, we devised a series of synthetic syntrophic communities to
	probe the complex interactions underlying metabolic exchange of amino
	acids. We experimentally analyzed multimember, multidimensional communities
	of Escherichia coli of increasing sophistication to assess the outcomes
	of synergistic crossfeeding. We find that biosynthetically costly
	amino acids including methionine, lysine, isoleucine, arginine, and
	aromatics, tend to promote stronger cooperative interactions than
	amino acids that are cheaper to produce. Furthermore, cells that
	share common intermediates along branching pathways yielded more
	synergistic growth, but exhibited many instances of both positive
	and negative epistasis when these interactions scaled to higher dimensions.
	In more complex communities, we find certain members exhibiting keystone
	species-like behavior that drastically impact the community dynamics.
	Based on comparative genomic analysis of \&gt;6,000 sequenced bacteria
	from diverse environments, we present evidence suggesting that amino
	acid biosynthesis has been broadly optimized to reduce individual
	metabolic burden in favor of enhanced crossfeeding to support synergistic
	growth across the biosphere. These results improve our basic understanding
	of microbial syntrophy while also highlighting the utility and limitations
	of current modeling approaches to describe the dynamic complexities
	underlying microbial ecosystems. This work sets the foundation for
	future endeavors to resolve key questions in microbial ecology and
	evolution, and presents a platform to develop better and more robust
	engineered synthetic communities for industrial biotechnology.},

	and in these cases the reduction appears to be driven by natural
	selection rather than drift. Gene loss in free-living organisms may
	leave them dependent on cooccurring microbes for lost metabolic functions.
	We present the Black Queen Hypothesis (BQH), a novel theory of reductive
	evolution that explains how selection leads to such dependencies;
	its name refers to the queen of spades in the game Hearts, where
	the usual strategy is to avoid taking this card. Gene loss can provide
	a selective advantage by conserving an organism’s limiting resources,
	provided the gene’s function is dispensable. Many vital genetic functions
	are leaky, thereby unavoidably producing public goods that are available
	to the entire community. Such leaky functions are thus dispensable
	for individuals, provided they are not lost entirely from the community.
	The BQH predicts that the loss of a costly, leaky function is selectively
	favored at the individual level and will proceed until the production
	of public goods is just sufficient to support the equilibrium community;
	at that point, the benefit of any further loss would be offset by
	the cost. Evolution in accordance with the BQH thus generates “beneficiaries�?
	of reduced genomic content that are dependent on leaky “helpers,�?
	and it may explain the observed nonuniversality of prototrophy, stress
	resistance, and other cellular functions in the microbial world.},

  year = {2006},
  author = {Nowak, Martin A.},
  abstract = {At a time of unprecedented expansion in the life sciences, evolution
	is the one theory that transcends all of biology. Any observation
	of a living system must ultimately be interpreted in the context
	of its evolution. Evolutionary change is the consequence of mutation
	and natural selection, which are two concepts that can be described
	by mathematical equations. Evolutionary Dynamics is concerned with
	these equations of life. In this book, Martin A. Nowak draws on the
	languages of biology and mathematics to outline the mathematical
	principles according to which life evolves. His work introduces readers
	to the powerful yet simple laws that govern the evolution of living
	systems, no matter how complicated they might seem. Evolution has
	become a mathematical theory, Nowak suggests, and any idea of an
	evolutionary process or mechanism should be studied in the context
	of the mathematical equations of evolutionary dynamics. His book
	presents a range of analytical tools that can be used to this end:
	fitness landscapes, mutation matrices, genomic sequence space, random
	drift, quasispecies, replicators, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, games in
	finite and infinite populations, evolutionary graph theory, games
	on grids, evolutionary kaleidoscopes, fractals, and spatial chaos.
	Nowak then shows how evolutionary dynamics applies to critical real-world
	problems, including the progression of viral diseases such as AIDS,
	the virulence of infectious agents, the unpredictable mutations that
	lead to cancer, the evolution of altruism, and even the evolution
	of human language. His book makes a clear and compelling case for
	understanding every living system—and everything that arises as a
	consequence of living systems—in terms of evolutionary dynamics.},

	multiple secretions, which can be exchanged among genotypes. We show
	that cooperation between genotypes only evolves under specific demographic
	regimes characterized by intermediate genetic mixing. The key constraint
	on cooperative exchanges is a loss of autonomy: strains become reliant
	on complementary genotypes that may not be reliably encountered.
	Moreover, the form of cooperation that we observe arises through
	mutual exploitation that is related to cheating and “Black Queen�?
	evolution for a single secretion. A major corollary is that the evolution
	of cooperative exchanges reduces community productivity relative
	to an autonomous strain that makes everything it needs. This prediction
	finds support in recent work from synthetic communities. Overall,

	bacterial cells are ubiquitous on biological and mineral surfaces
	in all habitats. Molecular and cellular biologists have unraveled
	some key mechanisms that modulate bacterial interactions, but the
	ecology and evolution of these associations remain poorly understood.
	One debate has focused on the relative importance of cooperation
	among cells in bacterial communities. Some researchers suggest that
	communication and cooperation, both within and among bacterial species,
	have produced emergent properties that give such groups a selective
	advantage. Evolutionary biologists have countered that the appearance
	of group-level traits should be viewed with caution, as natural selection
	almost invariably favors selfishness. A recent theory by Morris,
	Lenski, and Zinser, called the Black Queen Hypothesis, gives a new
	perspective on this debate (J. J. Morris, R. E. Lenski, and E. R.
	Zinser, mBio 3(2):e00036-12, 2012). These authors present a model
	that reshapes a decades-old idea: cooperation among species can be
	automatic and based upon purely selfish traits. Moreover, this hypothesis
	stands in contrast to the Red Queen Hypothesis, which states that
	species are in constant evolutionary conflict. Two assumptions serve
	as the core of the Black Queen model. First, bacterial functions
	are often leaky, such that cells unavoidably produce resources that
	benefit others. Second, the receivers of such by-products will tend
	to delete their own costly pathways for those products, thus building
	dependency into the interactions. Although not explicitly required
	in their model, an emergent prediction is that the initiation of
	such dependency can favor the spread of more obligate coevolved partnerships.
	This new paradigm suggests that bacteria might often form interdependent
	cooperative interactions in communities and moreover that bacterial
	cooperation should leave a clear genomic signature via complementary
	loss of shared diffusible functions.},

	power principle�?, often quoted in studies about the energy balance
	of living systems and also known in the emergy literature as “maximum
	em-power principle�?. Several authors consider this principle highly
	relevant and some even proposed it as a “fourth law of thermodynamics�?.
	A critical analysis of the original source, namely Alfred Lotka's
	1921–22 papers, conducted both in an historical perspective (the
	connection between Lotka's writings and the ongoing debate at his
	time) and in a more modern context, leads to a more detailed and
	less biased assessment. It turns out that in spite of Lotka's very
	anticipatory and incredibly sharp vision of the possible interconnections
	between the second law of thermodynamics and evolutionism, doubts
	arise about the general applicability of his “maximum power principle�?.
	From an accurate analysis of his writings, it can be concluded that:
	(a) Lotka explicitly and consistently addressed the “optimal use�?
	of the flow of exergy (available energy), and therefore the quantity
	defined as “em-power�? is an incorrect interpretation of Lotka's
	constrained maximum power principle; (b) “Lotka's principle�? can
	be reformulated within Ziegler's “maximum entropy production�? or
	Prigogine “minimum entropy generation�? paradigm only under two different
	respective sets of rather stringent additional conditions which Lotka
	was probably already aware of but never explicitly stated.},

  abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate
	detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce
	testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such
	as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along
	evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions
	at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier
	results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type
	E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although
	the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable,
	the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts
	or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary
	pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization
	of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that
	knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect
	to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic
	programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to
	the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint.
	Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for
	E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a
	significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further
	supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates.
	It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed
	metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal.
	MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding
	the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

	Here we show that persistent cooperation can be engineered by introducing
	a small set of genetic modifications into previously noninteracting
	cell populations. Specifically, we report the construction of a synthetic
	obligatory cooperative system, termed CoSMO (cooperation that is
	synthetic and mutually obligatory), which consists of a pair of nonmating
	yeast strains, each supplying an essential metabolite to the other
	strain. The behavior of the two strains in isolation, however, revealed
	unintended constraints that restrict cooperation, such as asymmetry
	in starvation tolerance and delays in nutrient release until near
	cell death. However, the joint system is shown mathematically and
	experimentally to be viable over a wide range of initial conditions,
	with oscillating population ratio settling to a value predicted by
	nutrient supply and consumption. Unexpectedly, even in the absence
	of explicitly engineered mechanisms to stabilize cooperation, the
	cooperative system can consistently develop increased ability to
	survive reductions in population density. Extending synthetic biology
	from the design of genetic circuits to the engineering of ecological
	interactions, CoSMO provides a quantitative system for linking processes
	at the cellular level to the collective behavior at the system level,

	for the performance of these fermentations. Yogurt fermentation by
	Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (basonym,
	Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) is one of the best-described
	mixed-culture fermentations. These species are believed to stimulate
	each other's growth by the exchange of metabolites such as folic
	acid and carbon dioxide. Recently, postgenomic studies revealed that
	an upregulation of biosynthesis pathways for nucleotides and sulfur-containing
	amino acids is part of the global physiological response to mixed-culture
	growth in S. thermophilus, but an in-depth molecular analysis of
	mixed-culture growth of both strains remains to be established. We
	report here the application of mixed-culture transcriptome profiling
	and a systematic analysis of the effect of interaction-related compounds
	on growth, which allowed us to unravel the molecular responses associated
	with batch mixed-culture growth in milk of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066
	and L. bulgaricus ATCC BAA-365. The results indicate that interactions
	between these bacteria are primarily related to purine, amino acid,
	and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The results support a model
	in which formic acid, folic acid, and fatty acids are provided by
	S. thermophilus. Proteolysis by L. bulgaricus supplies both strains
	with amino acids but is insufficient to meet the biosynthetic demands
	for sulfur and branched-chain amino acids, as becomes clear from
	the upregulation of genes associated with these amino acids in mixed
	culture. Moreover, genes involved in iron uptake in S. thermophilus
	are affected by mixed-culture growth, and genes coding for exopolysaccharide
	production were upregulated in both organisms in mixed culture compared
	to monocultures. The confirmation of previously identified responses
	in S. thermophilus using a different strain combination demonstrates
	their generic value. In addition, the postgenomic analysis of the
	responses of L. bulgaricus to mixed-culture growth allows a deeper

  abstract = {Metabolite sensing is one of the most fundamental biological processes.
	During evolution, multilayered mechanisms developed to sense fluctuations
	in a wide spectrum of metabolites, including nutrients, to coordinate
	cellular metabolism and biological networks. To date, {AMPK} and
	{mTOR} signaling are among the best-understood metabolite-sensing
	and signaling pathways. Here, we propose a sensor-transducer-effector
	model to describe known mechanisms of metabolite sensing and signaling.
	We define a metabolite sensor by its specificity, dynamicity, and
	functionality. We group the actions of metabolite sensing into three
	different modes: metabolite sensor-mediated signaling, metabolite-sensing
	module, and sensing by conjugating. With these modes of action, we
	provide a systematic view of how cells sense sugars, lipids, amino
	acids, and metabolic intermediates. In the future perspective, we
	suggest a systematic screen of metabolite-sensing macromolecules,
	high-throughput discovery of biomacromolecule-metabolite interactomes,
	and functional metabolomics to advance our knowledge of metabolite
	sensing and signaling. Most importantly, targeting metabolite sensing
	holds great promise in therapeutic intervention of metabolic diseases
	and in improving healthy aging.},

  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Metabolites are not only substrates in metabolic
	reactions, but also signaling molecules controlling a wide range

	provides an important link between metabolic dysfunction and cancer,
	unveiling the signaling function of metabolites in regulating epigenetic
	and epitranscriptomic modifications, genome integrity, and signal
	transduction. It is now known that cancer cells remodel their metabolic
	network to support biogenesis, caused by or resulting in the dysregulation
	of various metabolites. Cancer cells can sense alterations in metabolic
	intermediates to better coordinate multiple biological processes
	and enhance cell metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that

	to capture this information in genome-scale metabolic models, provide
	the possibility of comprehensively modeling microbial community interactions.
	For example, Rhodoferax and Geobacter species are acetate-oxidizing
	Fe(III)-reducers that compete in anoxic subsurface environments and
	this competition may have an influence on the in situ bioremediation
	of uranium-contaminated groundwater. Therefore, genome-scale models
	of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Rhodoferax ferrireducens were used
	to evaluate how Geobacter and Rhodoferax species might compete under
	diverse conditions found in a uranium-contaminated aquifer in Rifle,
	CO. The model predicted that at the low rates of acetate flux expected
	under natural conditions at the site, Rhodoferax will outcompete
	Geobacter as long as sufficient ammonium is available. The model
	also predicted that when high concentrations of acetate are added
	during in situ bioremediation, Geobacter species would predominate,
	consistent with field-scale observations. This can be attributed
	to the higher expected growth yields of Rhodoferax and the ability
	of Geobacter to fix nitrogen. The modeling predicted relative proportions
	of Geobacter and Rhodoferax in geochemically distinct zones of the
	Rifle site that were comparable to those that were previously documented
	with molecular techniques. The model also predicted that under nitrogen
	fixation, higher carbon and electron fluxes would be diverted toward
	respiration rather than biomass formation in Geobacter, providing
	a potential explanation for enhanced in situ U(VI) reduction in low-ammonium
	zones. These results show that genome-scale modeling can be a useful
	tool for predicting microbial interactions in subsurface environments

	Despite the growing availability of high-throughput sequencing and

	extent and directionality of interactions among them. This calls
	for development of efficient modeling frameworks to shed light on

	we introduce OptCom, a comprehensive flux balance analysis framework
	for microbial communities, which relies on a multi-level and multi-objective
	optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between
	individual vs. community level fitness criteria. In contrast to earlier
	approaches that rely on a single objective function, here, we consider
	species-level fitness criteria for the inner problems while relying
	on community-level objective maximization for the outer problem.
	OptCom is general enough to capture any type of interactions (positive,
	negative or combinations thereof) and is capable of accommodating
	any number of microbial species (or guilds) involved. We applied
	OptCom to quantify the syntrophic association in a well-characterized
	two-species microbial system, assess the level of sub-optimal growth
	in phototrophic microbial mats, and elucidate the extent and direction
	of inter-species metabolite and electron transfer in a model microbial
